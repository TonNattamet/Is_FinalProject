## Nutrient Requirements Table

| Nutrient (Column Name)   | Recommended Daily Intake           | Notes                                                     |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Calories-kcl**         | 2,000 - 2,500 kcal                 | Varies by age, gender, and activity level.                |

| **SaturatedFat-g**       | < 20 - 25 g                        | <10% of total calories to reduce heart disease risk.      |
| **MonounsaturatedFat-g** | 20 - 35 g (total fats)             | Focus on healthy fats like olive oil, nuts, and avocados. |
| **PolyunsaturatedFat-g** | 20 - 35 g (total fats)             | Includes omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids.                 |
| **TransFat-g**           | 0 g                                | Avoid trans fats as they increase heart disease risk.     |

## How to Use This Table

1. **Track Daily Intake**: Use the recommended values to monitor your daily nutrient intake.
2. **Adjust Your Diet**: Ensure you meet the daily requirements for essential nutrients like protein, fiber, and healthy fats while limiting unhealthy ones like sugar, sodium, and trans fats.
3. **Optimize Recipes**: Modify recipes to align with these guidelines for healthier eating.

---

## Notes

- **Calories**: Adjust based on your activity level and health goals (e.g., weight loss, maintenance, or gain).
- **Fats**: Focus on unsaturated fats (mono- and polyunsaturated) and avoid trans fats entirely.
- **Sodium**: Lower intake is better, especially for individuals with high blood pressure.
- **Sugar**: Minimize added sugars and focus on natural sources like fruits.

---

By following these guidelines, you can maintain a balanced diet and reduce the risk of chronic diseases like obesity, diabetes, and heart disease.

## Nutrient Intake and Disease Risks Table

| Nutrient (Column Name)   | **High Intake Risks**                                                         | **Low Intake Risks**                                                                     |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Calories-kcl**         | Obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, metabolic syndrome.                  | Malnutrition, fatigue, weakened immune system, muscle loss.                              |
| **Protein-g**            | Kidney strain, bone loss (if excessive and unbalanced with other nutrients).  | Muscle wasting, weakened immunity, hair loss, fatigue.                                   |
| **Carb-g**               | Weight gain, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes (if refined carbs dominate). | Fatigue, nutrient deficiencies, poor brain function (carbs are a primary energy source). |
| **Fiber-g**              | Bloating, gas (if increased suddenly).                                        | Constipation, increased cholesterol, higher risk of heart disease and colon cancer.      |
| **Sugar-g**              | Obesity, type 2 diabetes, tooth decay, heart disease, fatty liver disease.    | Low energy, but low sugar intake is generally beneficial.                                |
| **Sodium-g**             | High blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, kidney disease.                   | Hyponatremia (low sodium levels), dizziness, fatigue, muscle cramps.                     |
| **SaturatedFat-g**       | Increased LDL cholesterol, heart disease, stroke.                             | Potential deficiency in fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K) if overall fat is too low.     |
| **MonounsaturatedFat-g** | Weight gain (if overall calorie intake is excessive).                         | Increased risk of heart disease, poor absorption of fat-soluble vitamins.                |
| **PolyunsaturatedFat-g** | Weight gain (if overall calorie intake is excessive).                         | Increased risk of heart disease, poor brain function (omega-3 deficiency).               |
| **TransFat-g**           | Increased LDL cholesterol, decreased HDL cholesterol, heart disease, stroke.  | No risks (trans fats should be avoided entirely).                                        |

## Key Notes

1. **High Intake Risks**: Excessive consumption of certain nutrients (e.g., sugar, sodium, saturated fats) is linked to chronic diseases like obesity, diabetes, and heart disease.
2. **Low Intake Risks**: Insufficient intake of essential nutrients (e.g., protein, fiber, healthy fats) can lead to malnutrition, weakened immunity, and other health issues.
3. **Balance is Key**: Maintaining a balanced intake of nutrients is crucial for overall health and disease prevention.

## How to Use This Table

- **For Individuals**: Identify potential health risks based on your current diet and adjust nutrient intake accordingly.
- **For Food Manufacturers**: Develop baked foods that minimize high-risk nutrients (e.g., sugar, sodium, trans fats) and maximize beneficial ones (e.g., fiber, protein, healthy fats).
- **For Public Health**: Educate the public about the risks of high or low nutrient intakes and promote balanced diets.
